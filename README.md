# Mail_Merge
If you have plenty of initations to write, we have a solution. This project helps us to write numerous invitations without much work. This is created with the help of concepts of file handling, we are using local files in this project. 

# Description

We already have have a file called invited_names.txt in which we have names of the people we need to invite. Furthermore, we have also written a sample letter  withaout name in the file called starting_letter.txt. As soon as the user runs the code we will be delivered with all the letters with the names of people we need to invite.
